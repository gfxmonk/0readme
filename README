0readme
------

Replace the <description> tag of a 0install feed with the
current contents of a README file, properly XML-escaped.

This allows you to keep your feed's description up to date
with your README file.

If you don't have a README file, it will use the first file
in the current directory that starts with 'readme', ignoring
case.

Usage:
	0readme feed.xml
